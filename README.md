you can use this tool to test NKRO and how fast you can spam a key.

NKRO (N-key rollover) refers to a keyboard ability to register any number of keys at the same time.
most keyboards will only register up to 6 keys held.

down-to-up measures the time the key was held (from keyDown to keyUp event)
key-to-key measures the time from one key event to the next (from keyDown to the next keyDown)

each key time is recorded separately, so spamming multiple keys will not skew the actual time.
